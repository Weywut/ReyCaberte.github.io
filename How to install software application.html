<font color="red" size="5"><u><strong>How to install software?</u></strong><br />
<br />
<font color="black" size="4"><strong><center>The installation process for software or apps depends on your operating system (Windows and macOS), 
device (computer, smartphone, or tablet), and the program you are installing. As a result of these many combinations, 
we have created the steps below as a general guideline. The following does not cover errors during the installation process, 
as they are too vast for one page. Search our site for further information on specific errors during the setup.</center></strong><br/>
<br />

<font color="red" size="5"><u><strong><b>General tips</u></strong></b><br />
<br />

<b><font color="black" size="3">1.Ensure your computer meets the system requirements of the program, 
game, or utility you are attempting to install.</b><br />
<br />
<b><font color="black" size="3">2.The manual, or a readme file, usually contains instructions on how to install a program. 
Find it online at the software website or in a text file in the same directory as the installation files.</b><br />
<br />
<b><font color="black" size="3">3.If you have problems installing software or it takes a long time, close or disable any other running programs.<br />
<br />
<b><font color="black" size="3">4.After installing a new program, if it prompts you to reboot the computer, do so.</b><br />
<br />
<b><font color="black" size="3">5.Many computer games are downloaded and managed through digital distribution platforms like Steam.</b><br />
<br />

<font color="red" size="5"><strong><u>How to install from a CD or DVD</strong></u><br />
<br />
<b><strong><font color="black" size="3"><center>Many software titles (like the Microsoft Office suite), games, and utilities have an AutoPlay feature. 
This feature automatically starts a setup screen for the software when the CD (compact disc) or DVD (digital versatile disc) is inserted. 
If your program contains this feature, follow the steps that appear after inserting the disc into the computer.
If AutoPlay is disabled on your computer or unavailable on the software disc, follow these steps.</center></b></strong><br />
<br />
<font color="black" size="3"><b>1.Open My Computer.</b><br />
<br />
<font color="black" size="3"><b>2. In the My Computer window, 
open the drive containing the installation files. For example, 
if the files are on the CD-ROM (compact disc read-only memory) 
drive, open the D: drive or letter of your CD-ROM drive.</b><br />
<br />
<font color="black" size="3"><b>3. In the drive containing your files, locate either the executable setup (e.g., "setup.exe") 
or the install file. Double-clicking this file starts the installation process. 
If there are multiple setup or install files, locate the executable file or double-click each setup 
or install file until you find the file that starts the installation.</b><br />
<br />
<font color="red" size="5"><strong><u>Install a CD on a computer with no disc drive</strong></u><br />
<br />
<b><strong><font color="black" size="3">Many new computers no longer have disc drives. 
If your computer does not have a disc drive, try finding the software online. 
Computer drivers, software for hardware devices, games, and other programs are available for download and installed from a download. 
It doesn't matter where you get the program if you have the product key.</b><strong> <br />
<br />
<b><strong><font color="black" size="3"><center>If the program is unavailable for download, copy all the CD or DVD contents to another drive on another computer. 
For example, you could copy the disc's contents to a USB flash drive and then install the program from the USB flash drive.</center></b></strong><br />
<br />
<font color="red" size="5"><u><strong><b>How to install from a Download</u></strong></b><br />
<br />
<font color="black" size="3"><b>1. Download the program from the website providing the program.</b><br />
<br />
<font color="black" size="3"><b>2. Open the download folder. </b><br />
<br />
<font color="black" size="3"><b>3. If the file you downloaded is executable, double-click the file icon to start the setup process. 
If the downloaded file is compressed (e.g., .zip), you must extract the file's contents before setup can begin. 
Fortunately, this function is built into most versions of Windows. </b><br />
<br />
<font color="black" size="3"><b>4. Once the files are extracted, double-click the setup or install file to install the program. </b><br />
